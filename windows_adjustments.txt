1. in windows, you must observ directories and not the files itself
2. in windows, put full path for conf file
3. in windows, while true program dont let service to start ??


for creating zip - 
pyinstaller --onefile cdlog.py

create service using nssm - 
install nssm from their website
** important to be in nssm directory - 
** Include nssm in the zip 
** need to change the current path to the path of the folder with all the files in powershell **********
just run the install_cdlog.ps1 script
nssm install ServiceName "C:\Users\Ofek Ellenbogen\Desktop\dist\try_service.exe"
net start ServiceName

# the zip should contain 4 files: cdlog, cdlog.conf and install_cdlog.ps1, nssm
this file is saved here

for creating msi installer with advanced installer
adding all four files to files: cdlog.exe, cdlog.conf, nssm, install_cdlog.ps1
building, thats it
